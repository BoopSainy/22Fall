semi-supervised learning uses both labeled and unlabeled data to train a model.

interestingly, most existing literature on semi-supervised learning focuses on
vision tasks;

from "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05278.pdf"

deep neural networks demonstrated their ability to provide remarkable performances
on a wide range of supervised learning tasks (e.g., image classification) when 
trained on extensive collections of labeled data (e.g., ImageNet). However, creating
such large datasets requires a considerable amount of resources, time, and effort.
Such resources may not be available in many practical cases, limiting the adoption
and the application of many deep learning methods. In a search for more 
data-efficient deep learning methods to overcome the need for large annotated 
datasets, there is a rising research interest in semi-supervised learning and its
applications to deep neural networks to reduce the amount of labeled data required,
by either developing novel methods or adopting existing semi-supervised learning 
frameworks for a deep learning setting. in this paper, we provide a comprehensive
overview of deep semi-supervised learning, starting with an introduction to the field,
followed by a summarization of the dominant semi-supervised approaches in deep 
learning.

introduction:
In recent years, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an exciting new 
research direction in deep learning. Such methods deal with the situation where few
labeled training examples are available together with a significant number of 
unlabeled samples. In such a setting, SSL methods are more applicable to real-world
applications where the unlabeled data are readily available and easy to acquire,
while labeled instances are often hard, expensive, and time-consuming to collect.
SSL is capable of building better classifiers that compensate for the lack of labeled
training data. {半监督学习适用于的场景：由于labeling的成本太高，只有少量labeled数据，
但是却有海量unlabeled数据。} However, in order to avoid a lousy matching of the problem
structure with model assumption, which can lead to a degradation in classification
performance, SSL is only effective under certain assumptions, such as assuming
that the decision boundary should avoid regions with high density, facilitating the
extraction of additional information from the unlabeled instances to regularize
training. {半监督学习的生效前提：建立在一系列的假设基础上，比如在半监督学习的分类问题上，
我们假设半监督学习所找到的decision boundary要远离样本点密集区域。我们会通过增加新的
regularization term去施加这些假设} In this paper, we will start by an introduction to
SSL with its main assumptions and methods, followed by a summarization of the 
dominant semi-supervised approaches in deep learning. For a detailed and comprehensive
review of the field, Semi-Supervised Learning Book is a good resource.

1.1 Semi-supervised learning
"semi-supervised learning (SSL) is halfway between supervised and unsupervised 
learning. In addition to unlabeled data, the algorithm is provided with some 
supervision information - but not necessarily for all examples. Often, this 
information will be the targets associated with some of the examples. In this case,
the data set X = (x_i); i (- [n] can be divided into two parts: the points 
X_l := (x_1, x_2, ..., x_l), for which labels Y_l := (y_1, y_2, ..., y_l) are 
provided, and the points X_u := (x_l+1, x_l+2, ..., x_l+u), the labels of which 
are not known." - Chapelle et al.

As stated in the definition above, in SSL, we are provided with a dataset containing
both labeled and unlabeled examples. The portion of labeled examples is usually quite
small compared to the unlabeled example (e.g., 1 to 10% of the total number of 
examples). So with a dataset D containing a labeled subset D_l and an unlabeled
subset D_u, the objective, or rather hope, is to leverage the unlabeled examples
to train a better performing model than what can be obtained using only the labeled
portion. {这里说了很多，但是就表达了一个意思，就是我们现在的数据集将由两部分样本组成，一部分是
有标签的样本，这部分通常只占到总量的10%以内，剩下的大部分都是unlabeled样本。
另一方面，SSL的目的/希望是：能够利用起来unlabeled样本去训练一个SSL模型，这个模型的表现要优于
只用那少部分labeled样本做监督学习所得到的模型。} And hopefully, get closer to the desired
optimal performance, in which all of the dataset D is labeled. {这里又补充了一下目的：
希望SSL能够更进一步，去得到一个模型，它的效果近似于数据集里的样本都labeled，然后再监督学习
得到的模型}

More formally, the goal of SSL is to leverage the unlabeled data D_u to produce a 
prediction function f_theta with trainable parameters theta, that is more accurate
than what would have been obtained by only using the labeled data D_l. For instance,
D_u might provide us with additional information about the structure of the data
distribution p(x) to better estimate the decision boundary between the different 
classes. {unlabeled数据也许能给我们提供额外的有用信息，比如说我们可以得到一个更加详细的
样本的分布情况，进而能estimate出一个更加精确的decision boundary} For example, as shown in 
fig.1, where the data points with distinct labels are separated with a low-density
region, leveraging unlabeled data with a SSL approach can provide us with additional
information about the shape of the decision boundary between two classes, and reduce 
the ambiguity present in the supervised case.

SSL first appeared in the form of self-training, which is also known as self-labeling
or self-teaching. A model is first trained on labeled data. Then, iteratively, a
portion of the unlabeled data is annotated using the trained model and added to the
training set for the next iteration. SSL took off in the 1970s after its success
with iterative algorithms such as the expectation-maximization algorithm, in which
the labeled and unlabeled data are jointly used to maximize the likelihood of the
model.

1.2 SSL Methods
There have been many SSL methods and approaches that have been introduced over the
years. These algorithms can be broadly divided into the following categories:
