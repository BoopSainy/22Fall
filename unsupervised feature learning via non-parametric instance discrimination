neural net classifiers trained on data with annotated class labels can also capture apparent visual
similarity among categories without being directed to do so. We study whether this observation 
can be extended beyond the conventional domain of supervised learning: Can we learn a good feature
representation that captures apparent similarity among instances, instead of classes, by merely asking
the feature to be


introduction:

the rise of deep neural networks, especially convolutional neural networks, has led to several break-
throughs in computer vision benchmarks. most successful models are traiend via supervised learning,
which requires large datasets that are completely annotated for a specific task. however, obtaining
annotated data is often very costly or even infeasible in certain cases. in recent years, unsupervised
learning has received increasing attention from the community.

our novel approach to unsupervised learning stems from a few observations on the results of supervised
learning for object recognition. on imagenet, the top-5 classification error is significantly lower
than the top-1 error, and the second highest responding class in the softmax output to an image is more
likely to be visually related.

our unsupervised approach takes the class-wise supervision to the extreme and learns a feature 
representation that discriminates among individual instances.
Fig.1 shows that an image from class leopard is rated much higher by class jaguar rather than by
class bookcase. such observations reveal that a typical discriminative learning method can automatically
discover apparent similarity among semantic categories, without being explicitly guided to do so. in other 
words, apparent similarity is learned not from semantic annotations, but from the visual data themselves.

we take the class-wise supervision to the extreme of instance-wise supervision, and ask: can we learn
a meaningful metric that reflects aparent similarity among instances via
