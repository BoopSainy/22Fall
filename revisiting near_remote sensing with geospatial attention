abstract:
this work addresses the task of overhead image segmentation when auxiliary ground-level images are avaiable.
recent work has shown that performing joint inference over these two modalities, often called near/remote sensing, can yield
significant accuracy improvements. extending this line of work, we introduce the concept of geospatial attention, a geometry-aware
attention mechanism that explicitly considers the geospatial relationship between the pixels in a ground-level image and a geographic
location. 

we propose an approach for computing geospatial attention that incorporates geometric features and the appearance of the overhead and
ground-level imagery. we introduce a novel architecture for near/remoting sensing that is based on geospatial attention and demonstrate
its use for five segmentation tasks. the results demonstrate that our method siginificantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
method.

introduction,

accurately monitoring the earth's surface is critical to many scientific fields and to society at large. important applications include
weather forecasting, disaster response, population density estimation, and environmental monitoring. traditionally these applciations
have relied on remote sensing approaches applied to overhead imagery from satellite or airborne cameras
