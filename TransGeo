The procedure to complete geo-localization by cross-view image?

How to use polar transform?


To bridge the domain gap, recent works apply a predefined polar transform, on
the aerial-view images. The transformed aerial images have a similar geometric
layout as the street-view query images,

{输入将是street-view query images, 将在aerial images database中检索那个“相似度”最高的
aerial image, 实现geo-localization.}
 
<- CNN method Limitations { cant capture global correlation; cant utilize patches
position information, which leads to suffer the domain gap between street-view
and aerial-view}

<- To solve this issue { cnn-based will utilize a polar transform tech which 
could transform aerial view image to a geometric layout similar to street-view}

which results in significant boost in the retrieval performance. However, the p
polar transform relies on the prior knowledge of the geometry corresponding to 
the
