IoU:
intersection over union
we just mentioned that an anchor box "well" surrounds the dog in the image. if the ground-truth bounding box of the object
of the object is known, how can "well" here be quantified? intuitively, we can measure the similarity between the
anchor box and the ground-truth bounding box. we know that the jaccard index can meansure the similarity between two sets.
given sets A and B, their jaccard index is the size of their intersection divided by the sie of their union:
A \intersection B / A \union B
in fact, we can consider the pixel area of any bounding box as a set of pixels. in this way, we can measure the similarity
of the two bounding boxes by the jaccard index of their pixel sets. {把两个bounding boxes当作是两个pixel sets，接着
jaccard index可以用来衡量两个sets的相似程度，于是使用jaccard index我们可以衡量两个sets的相似率} for two bounding boxes, we usually
refer their jaccard index as intersection over union (IoU), which is the ratio of their intersection area to their
union area, as shown in Fig.... The range of an IoU is between 0 to 1. 0means that two bounding boxes do not overlap at all,
while 1 indicates that the two bounding boxes are equal.

for the remainder of this section, we will use IoU to measure the similarity between anchor boxes and ground-truth bounding
boxes, and between different anchor boxes.
