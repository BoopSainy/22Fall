Introduction:
Yann LeCun described it as "the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in machine learning". of course,
such a compliment coming from such a prominent researcher in the deep learning area is always a great advertisement
for the subject wa are talking about! and, indeed, generative adversarial networks (gans for short) have had
a huge success since they were introduced in 2014 by Ian J. Goodfellow and co-authors in the article...

so what are generative adversarial networks? what makes them so "interesting"? in this post, we will see that
adversarial training is an enlightening idea, beautiful by its simplicity, that represents a real conceptual progress
for machine learning and more especially for generative models (in the same way as backpropagation is a simple
